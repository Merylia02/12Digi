    <h1>What's happening</h1>
    <br><p>People these days are wasting resources. Many of the resources that can be recycled are wasted because we are either uninformed or too lazy to do something. You might be wasting something right you might not know it or you just don’t know the consequences. This is a big problem because the resource we have aren’t infinite and these wasted materials may end up harming us.</p>
    <br><p>Another thing that is happening today is the fact that people don’t know how to properly recycle. Things in the recycling bin look identical to things that are going in the landfill; This shouldn’t be the case because not everything can be recycled, but it is. In order to recycle people would have to individually sort out the trash in order to recycle anything recyclable because of peoples laziness.</p>
    <br><p>People are also throwing away their trash where ever they want into our environment, which is the worst possible action. People are just randomly throwing their trash around because they are too lazy to hold it untill they find a trash bin. This is happening all over the world right now. If you are doing it you are damaging the world around you.</p>
